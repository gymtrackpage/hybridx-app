// "Win back athletes who cancelled in the last 60 days — three emails over two
// weeks, lead with the race planner" becomes a trigger, an audience, and a
// sequence of email briefs with waits and exit rules between them.

// This flow plans; it does not write the emails. Separating the two means the
// plan can be reviewed and edited before any copy is generated, and a single
// email can be redrafted later without disturbing the sequence around it.

## Your task
Turn the request below into a concrete campaign plan.

Rules:
- Choose exactly one trigger. Use "manual" for a one-off broadcast the marketer
  will send by hand, and "scheduled" for a one-off with a set date. Use an event
  or derived trigger only when the request describes something that should
  happen automatically for each person.
- A one-off broadcast is a plan with a single email step and no waits.
- Alternate email and wait steps. Never place two email steps back to back.
- Space emails sensibly: a welcome series moves quickly (hours to a couple of
  days); a winback breathes (three to seven days). Never more than five emails.
- Each email brief must state a distinct job. If two briefs could produce the
  same email, merge them.
- Use only tags that appear in the segment list in the facts above. If no tag
  fits, leave audience.anyTags empty and describe the audience in words instead.
- Pick exitOnConversion so the journey stops as soon as its purpose is met. A
  winback ends when the subscription becomes active; an activation series ends
  when a workout is logged. Use "none" only for pure newsletters.
- Never invent a price, trial length, programme name or statistic.
