// Lead intake from any funnel.
//
// The marketing site captures the top of the funnel — the VO2max guide, the
// race-day card, the free plan, and whatever promotion is running this month —
// into its own Firestore project. Those people are the audience the mailing
// system exists to serve, and this is how they reach it, at write time, so
// someone is mailable seconds after submitting rather than after a nightly
// reconciliation.
//
// The payload is *parsed*, not trusted, against a single declared contract. The
// two halves of this bridge were previously two independently-written shapes
// that agreed by coincidence until they did not — see bridge-contract.ts.
