// src/lib/marketing/capture.ts
//
// The single entry point for every address that enters the mailing system —
// the marketing site's magnets, the app's homepage form, account sync, the
// Android beta request, an admin adding someone by hand, a CSV import.
//
// Two things are centralised here rather than left to each call site:
//
//   1. **Route resolution.** Callers name the route they represent; this module
//      asks lib/marketing/sources.ts what that means in terms of tags, coarse
//      source and consent posture. Adding an intake path is a registry entry,
//      not a scattering of literals across route handlers.
//
//   2. **Event emission.** Journeys enrol from `marketingEvents` and nothing
//      else. Before this, no capture path raised an event at all, so a lead
//      captured by any route landed on the list and then received silence —
//      every automation in the system was unreachable from the top of the
//      funnel. Emitting here means a route cannot be added that forgets to.
