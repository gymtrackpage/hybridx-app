// Post-generation fact checking.
//
// Prompting a model to use only supplied facts works most of the time. "Most of
// the time" is not good enough when the output goes to thousands of people
// under your own brand, so every generated draft is checked against the same
// snapshot that produced it before a human ever sees it.
//
// This deliberately checks a small number of things very reliably rather than
// attempting general truth-checking: prices, trial lengths, programme names and
// fabricated statistics are the claims that (a) recur, (b) are checkable
// mechanically, and (c) cause real damage when wrong.
