// src/lib/marketing/bridge-contract.ts
//
// The wire contract between a funnel and the mailing system.
//
// This exists because the two halves drifted. The marketing site sent
// `utm: { source, medium, campaign }`; this app read `utm.utm_source`. Both
// were internally consistent, both typechecked, neither knew about the other —
// and so every lead's first-touch attribution was quietly discarded from the
// day the bridge was built. Nothing failed. The data was simply not there.
//
// Two independently-declared shapes that must match will eventually not match.
// So the contract is declared once, here, parsed rather than trusted, and
// published at GET /api/marketing/leads so anything building a new funnel can
// read what the fields are instead of guessing from an example.
//
// Compatibility is deliberate: both UTM spellings are accepted and normalised.
// A future funnel should not have to know which of them history settled on, and
// a contract that rejects the callers it already has is not a contract, it is
// an outage.
