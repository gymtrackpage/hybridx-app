// Bounded parallelism for cron jobs that fan out per user.
//
// `Promise.all(users.map(...))` is the obvious shape and the wrong one once the
// work inside makes a network call. It starts every request at once, so a job
// that behaves fine with twenty users floods a provider at two thousand and
// comes back rate-limited — and the failure arrives all at once, at 3am, on the
// run nobody is watching.

/**
 * Map over items with at most `limit` operations in flight.
 *
 * Results keep the input order regardless of completion order. A rejection
 * propagates, as with Promise.all — callers that want partial success should
 * catch inside `fn`, which is what the cron routes do so one bad user cannot
 * abandon the rest of the run.
