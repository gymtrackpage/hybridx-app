# Workout Display Improvements âœ¨

## What Was Improved

### 1. **Text Formatting Utility** ([text-formatter.ts](src/utils/text-formatter.ts))
Created a smart text formatter that:
- Detects bullet points (-, â€¢, *, numbered lists)
- Splits text by line breaks (handles both `\n` and `\\n`)
- Removes bullet prefixes while preserving content
- Returns structured data for proper rendering

### 2. **Expandable Workout Details**
Each workout card now has a "Show Details" button that reveals:

#### For HYROX/Strength Workouts:
- **Numbered exercise cards** with circular badges (1, 2, 3...)
- **Exercise names** in bold
- **Bullet points** properly formatted on new lines with `â€¢` prefix
- **Regular text** displayed as paragraphs
- Beautiful card backgrounds with hover effects

#### For Running Workouts:
- **Run descriptions** with numbered badges
- **Distance** and **pace zone** displayed
- Clean, scannable layout

### 3. **Visual Improvements**
- Each exercise in its own card with subtle background
- Numbered badges for easy reference
- Proper spacing between bullet points
- Indentation for nested details
- Collapsible sections to keep the list clean

## Example Display

**Before:**
```
Back Squat: 4 sets x 8-10 reps â€¢ Rest 90s â€¢ Focus on depth â€¢ Keep core tight
```

**After:**
```
ðŸ”µ 1  Back Squat
      â€¢ 4 sets x 8-10 reps
      â€¢ Rest 90s
      â€¢ Focus on depth
      â€¢ Keep core tight
```
