# AI Program Adjustment - Signup Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The signup flow now includes **intelligent AI-powered program adjustment** that automatically tailors training programs to match each user's available training days.

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### Core Feature
When a user signs up and selects a training program that has more workout days than they specified in their frequency preference, the app automatically:

1. ✅ Detects the mismatch
2. ✅ Calls AI to intelligently condense the program
3. ✅ Saves the personalized version to their profile
4. ✅ Shows confirmation in success message

### Example Flow

**User Profile:**
- Frequency preference: **4 days/week**
- Selected program: **Hyrox Run Performance (5 days/week)**

**What Happens:**
1. User clicks "Start Now" in Step 6
2. System detects: 5-day program > 4-day preference
3. Toast appears: *"Tailoring your program... Our AI coach is adjusting the program to fit your schedule."*
4. AI condenses 5 days → 4 days intelligently
5. Account created with adjusted program
6. Success message: *"Account Created! Welcome. Your selected program is ready to start! We've intelligently adjusted it to fit your 4-day schedule!"*

## 🧠 How the AI Works

### Adjustment Criteria

The AI adjustment is triggered when **ALL** conditions are met:

1. ✅ User selected a program (didn't skip)
2. ✅ Selected program is Hyrox type
3. ✅ User's frequency is NOT '5+'
4. ✅ Program has MORE non-rest workouts than user's frequency

### AI Intelligence

The AI uses strength & conditioning expertise to:

- **Analyze** the original program structure and goals
- **Prioritize** critical workouts that must be kept
- **Combine** complementary sessions (e.g., strength + conditioning)
- **Drop** lower priority workouts (light recovery, redundant sessions)
- **Restructure** the week to distribute workouts logically
- **Maintain** program effectiveness in condensed format

### Example Adjustments

**5-Day Program → 3-Day Adjustment:**
```
Original:
Day 1: Lower Body Power
Day 2: Speed Intervals
Day 3: Upper Body Strength
Day 4: Active Recovery
Day 5: Compromised Running
Day 6: Long Run
Day 7: Rest

Adjusted (3 days):
Day 1: Full Body Strength & Power (combined Day 1 + 3)
Day 3: Speed & Conditioning (combined Day 2 + 5)
Day 5: Long Run & Mobility (Day 6 + essential recovery)
Days 2, 4, 6, 7: Rest
```

## 💾 Database Schema

### User Document - New Field

```typescript
{
  // ... existing fields
  programId: "mTSbnEGsI9nzqDccm90B",    // Original program ID
  customProgram: [                        // 🆕 AI-adjusted workouts
    {
      day: 1,
      title: "Full Body Strength & Power",
      programType: "hyrox",
      exercises: [...]
    },
    {
      day: 3,
      title: "Speed & Conditioning",
      programType: "hyrox",
      exercises: [...]
    },
    // ... more workouts
  ],
  startDate: "2025-10-01"
}
```

### Display Logic

When showing workouts to users:
- If `customProgram` exists → Use AI-adjusted version
- If `customProgram` is null → Fetch from original `programId`

---

## 🎨 User Experience

### Success Messages

**Without Adjustment:**
> "Account Created! Welcome. Your selected program is ready to start!"

**With Adjustment (3 days):**
> "Account Created! Welcome. Your selected program is ready to start! We've intelligently adjusted it to fit your 3-day schedule!"

**With Adjustment (4 days):**
> "Account Created! Welcome. Your selected program is ready to start! We've intelligently adjusted it to fit your 4-day schedule!"

**No Program Selected:**
> "Account Created! Welcome. You can select a program from your dashboard."

### Loading States

During AI adjustment, users see:
> "Tailoring your program... Our AI coach is adjusting the program to fit your schedule."

## 🛡️ Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

If AI adjustment fails:
- ✅ Account creation still succeeds
- ✅ Original program still assigned
- ✅ User can start training immediately
- ❌ `customProgram` set to null (uses original)
- 📝 Error logged to console

**Code:**
```typescript
try {
  const result = await adjustTrainingPlan(...);
  customProgram = result.adjustedWorkouts;
} catch (adjustError) {
  console.error('Program adjustment failed:', adjustError);
  // Continue without adjustment
}
```
